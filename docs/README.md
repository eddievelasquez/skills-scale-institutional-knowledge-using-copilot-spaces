# OctoAcme Project Management Process

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This guide provides new contributors with a quick overview of how we run projects, from initial concept through deployment and continuous improvement. Our approach emphasizes customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Projects follow a structured lifecycle: **Initiation** validates the business need and creates a lightweight project one-pager with success metrics; **Planning** breaks work into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria and a release timeline; **Execution** delivers features through daily standups, weekly syncs, and demos using project boards with defined columns (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done); **Release** deploys validated code to production with smoke tests and rollback plans; and **Retrospective** captures learnings and improvement actions after each sprint or milestone.

Core roles drive project success: **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; **Product Managers (PdM)** define outcomes, prioritize the roadmap, and measure customer value; **Developers** implement features, write tests, and participate in design reviews; **QA/Testing** validates quality and acceptance criteria; and **Stakeholders** provide inputs, approvals, and business context. Our workflows emphasize small, focused pull requests (≤400 lines when possible) that include issue links and acceptance criteria, run automated tests and linting in CI before review, and require at least one approval before merging. We maintain project boards to track progress transparently and ensure all work items have clear definitions of done.

Communication follows a regular cadence to keep everyone aligned: **daily standups** (15 minutes) focus on progress, blockers, and dependencies; **weekly PM + PdM syncs** review status, risks, and decisions; **sprint demos** showcase completed work at milestone boundaries; **monthly stakeholder updates** provide high-level progress and metrics; and a three-level **escalation path** (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) handles blockers efficiently. Quality assurance practices are woven throughout delivery: developers write **unit tests** for new logic and **integration tests** for component interactions; we run **end-to-end smoke tests** for critical user flows before releases; **security scanning** runs automatically in CI pipelines; **manual QA** validates feature acceptance when needed; and every release includes a documented **rollback playbook** to mitigate production issues quickly.
